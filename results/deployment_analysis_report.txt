DRAWDOWN TOLERANCE CHECK
========================================
User Tolerance: 5-8%
Strategy Max DD: 1.94%
SPY Max DD: 33.72%
Strategy Within Tolerance: YES ✓
SPY Within Tolerance: NO ✗

IDENTIFIED RISKS
========================================
  1. Strategy shows high variance across time periods (Sharpe std > 1.3)
  2. Only 5-6 out of 8 walk-forward folds were profitable
  3. Current backtest period may not represent future conditions
  4. Small capital amplifies transaction cost impact
  5. Limited diversification with single-asset (IWM) concentration

RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS
========================================
  1. Start with paper trading for 3-6 months to verify signals
  2. Use larger capital ($5K+) to reduce transaction cost drag
  3. Implement strict position sizing (max 2% risk per trade)
  4. Monitor for regime changes that invalidate model
  5. Set monthly review checkpoints to evaluate performance

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================
VERDICT: PAPER TRADE FIRST
CONFIDENCE: Low-Medium

Action Items:
  1. Investigate why strategy underperforms SPY
  2. Consider alternative feature engineering
  3. Test different asset allocation strategies
  4. Evaluate longer training periods
  5. Compare against other benchmarks (QQQ, IWM itself)

================================================================================
CRITICAL BOTTOM LINE FOR USER
================================================================================
✗ Strategy DOES NOT beat SPY on absolute returns (-99.79%)
✓ Strategy DOES beat SPY on risk-adjusted basis (Sharpe +0.377)
✗ $2K capital NOT recommended (need $4,500)
✓ Max drawdown 1.9% is within 5-8% tolerance
