## Executive Summary

| Metric | V17 (Before) | V18 (After) | Change |
|--------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| CAGR | -12.8% | -1.7% | +11.1% |
| Sharpe | -1.35 | -0.26 | - |
| Max DD | -21.1% | -6.9% | - |

**Result:** ⚠️ Still negative, needs further work

## Key Insight

The diagnostic showed that **momentum factors had negative IC** in the recent market regime.
By **flipping** these factors (using them as contrarian/reversal signals), 
we align with the actual market behavior.

### Before (V17):
- Used momentum_12_1, momentum_6m as "buy winners"
- These had negative IC → buying losers

### After (V18):
- Flipped momentum factors → "buy recent losers"
- Weighted by |IC| → strongest signals get most weight

## Next Steps

1. **If CAGR > 0%:** Factor calibration works - proceed to regime-specific weights
2. **If CAGR < 0%:** Review factor computation for bugs, try simpler model
