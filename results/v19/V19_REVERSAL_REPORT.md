## Strategy Logic

```
1. Calculate 5-day returns for all stocks
2. Filter: Only stocks down 10-40% from 20-day high (quality dip)
3. Rank filtered stocks cross-sectionally (worst to best)
4. LONG: Bottom 50 performers (biggest losers)
5. Mode: LONG-ONLY (shorts removed - hurt in trending regimes)
6. Equal weight positions (100% invested)
7. Rebalance every 5 days
8. Transaction cost: 10 bps round-trip
```

## Why Reversal Works

Based on V18 diagnostic:
- **reversal_5d** factor has IC = +0.061 (positive predictive power)
- All **momentum** factors have NEGATIVE IC (momentum fails in current regime)
- Current HMM regime: **LowVolMeanRevert** (42% of time)

The market is rewarding **mean reversion**, not **trend following**.

## Next Steps

**Phase 1 targets met!** Proceed to Phase 2: Mean Reversion Overlay.
