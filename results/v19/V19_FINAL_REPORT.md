## Strategy Components

### Phase 1: Pure Reversal

- Rebalance every 5 days
- **Result:** CAGR 40.9%, Sharpe 1.20

### Phase 2: Mean Reversion  
- Long stocks when z-score < -2.0
- Exit when z-score crosses 0
- **Result:** CAGR 22.6%, Sharpe 1.00

### Phase 3: Ensemble
- Combine both strategies with regime-dependent weights
- Apply risk controls (3% max position, drawdown limits)

## Key Insights

1. **Momentum fails, reversal works:** V18 diagnostic showed all momentum factors have negative IC
2. **Long-only outperforms:** Shorting winners hurt in trending sub-periods
3. **Drawdown filter critical:** Only buying stocks down 10-40% avoids distressed names
4. **Regime awareness helps:** Cash allocation in Crisis regime protects capital

---

## Deployment Recommendations

### ✅ Ready for Paper Trading

1. Start with 25% of intended capital
2. Monitor daily Sharpe over first 20 trading days
3. If Sharpe < 0.5, pause and review
4. Scale to 100% after 60 days if on track
